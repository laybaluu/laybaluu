👋🏼 Hi, I'm Leah Bowers (she/they)
<br>
<br>
🔷 I’m a computational chemist turned data analyst and strategy consultant based in Brooklyn, NY. My background is in renewable energy research and nonprofit strategy. I talk about my career transition in this <a href = "https://www.womeninanalytics.com/podcast-episodes/ep12"> Women in Analytics podcast episode </a>!
<br>
<br>
✨ I’m interested in analysis that brings about better products, programs, and user experiences. I primarily use Excel, SQL, and Python in Jupyter Notebooks to analyze my data and Tableau to make it accessible.
<br>
<br>
🌱 I am currently constantly learning new things, but these days I'm tackling HTML/JS/CSS to help my friends make amazing websites that showcase their talents!
<br>
<br>
💕 I love creating and being a part of spaces where data and tech overlap with non-traditional fields (i.e. data and art, data and the nonprofit sector, and many others).
<br>
