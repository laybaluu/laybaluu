👋🏼 Hi, I'm Leah (lay-uh, she/they)
<br>
<br>
🔷 I’m a computational chemist turned business operations specialist based in Brooklyn, NY. My background is in business analytics and non-profit strategy - I talk about my career transition in this <a href = "https://www.womeninanalytics.com/podcast-episodes/ep12" target="_blank"> Women in Analytics podcast episode </a>!
<br>
<br>
✨ I’m interested in data strategy that focuses on research, quantitative and qualitative data, and centers users to bring about better products, programs, workflows, and user experiences. I primarily use Excel (Power Query), SQL, and Python in Jupyter Notebooks to analyze my data and Power BI to make it accessible.
<br>
<br>
🌱 I am constantly learning new things, but these days I'm leveling up my SQL skills and tackling HTML/JS/CSS to help my friends make amazing websites that showcase their talents!
<br>
<br>
💕 I love creating and being a part of spaces where data and tech overlap with people (i.e. data and art, data and the nonprofit sector, and many others).
<br>
